TwiGrid
=======

... is an experimental DataGrid for Nette Framework.

It's based on another (and great) datagrid written by @hrach - https://github.com/nextras/datagrid. My datagrid is hugely inspired and I would like to give this man a maximum credit and respect :-)

However - I did some things differently or have used a different approach.

I liked the idea of UI antipatternity of paginating, built my datagrid using Twitter Bootstrap styling and "componentized" the datagrid template so that you can extend it and customize it the way you like.

Please see the demo example for usage of this component here: https://github.com/uestla/twigrid-demo
